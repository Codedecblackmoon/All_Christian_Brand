            <p>At All Christian, we operate as an online business, utilizing a print-on-demand model.
                This means that we don't hold stock of our products. Instead, we produce and ship
                items only after an order has been placed.</p>

Payment Processing
When you place an order with us, your payment is processed immediately. Please note
that it takes 3 to 5 business days to process and fulfil your order. Once your order has
been processed, you will receive a confirmation massage with an update on your order.

Delivery Policy
We offer delivery services to customers. The delivery fee is calculated based on the
distance between our production facility and your shipping address. The delivery fee will
be displayed at checkout, before you complete your order.

Delivery Timeframes
Please allow 3 to 5 business days for processing, plus the additional delivery time,
which varies depending on your location. We will provide you with tracking information
once your order has shipped, so you can stay up-to-date on the status of your delivery.

Cancellation Policy
Due to the print-on-demand nature of our business, we cannot guarantee cancellations
or changes to orders once they have been placed. However, we will do our best to
accommodate requests made within 24 hours of placing the order.

Refund Policy
We strive to provide high-quality products and services. If you are not satisfied with your
