            <p>At All Christian, we operate as an online business, utilizing a print-on-demand model.
                This means that we don't hold stock of our products. Instead, we produce and ship
                items only after an order has been placed.</p>

When you place an order with us, your payment is processed immediately. Please note

Delivery Policy
We offer delivery services to customers. The delivery fee is calculated based on the

which varies depending on your location. We will provide you with tracking information
